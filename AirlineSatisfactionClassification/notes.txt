Dataset Notes:
    All numerical value data entries are non-null EXCEPT for 'Arrival Delay in Minutes' which is missing ~400,
    because the value 0 is appears in many entries for this feature, we cannot assume that the missing values should be 0.
    because there is so much data, we will remove all entries for which this value is missing

    All category feature values are present for the entire dataset
